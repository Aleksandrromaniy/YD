The instructions for the tests are in `api-test.ts` and `component-test.tsx` respectively.

To install the necessary dependencies, in the current directory, run. This requires you to have `node.js` and `npm` installed on your system.
```bash
npm install
```
Feel free to add any projects to `package.json`.

The final solution must be pushed to a VCS of your choice (github, gitlab or bitbucket) and shared with us.
